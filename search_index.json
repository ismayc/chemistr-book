HTML is the preferred format but the PDF format may be preferred for some readers. Links to the different GIFs directly found in the HTML version are provided in the PDF version. This resource is designed to assist students in CHEM 101/102 in using RStudio and R Markdown to complete their labs. (A more general reference to the specifics of R, RStudio and R Markdown is available in a different free book here). This resource will show you GIFs explaining how to do some common procedures you’ll need to do to complete labs. In addition, it will provide more details about the specifics of the different lab templates available in the chemistr R package. Each chapter of this book will correspond to each of the different labs. If further clarification is needed on any other aspect of the book, please email me with a reference to the error/area where more guidance is necessary.

It is recommended that you use Google Chrome as your browser since GIFs sometimes do not load automatically with other browsers. Starting The Labs Logging in and initial screen The RStudio Server provides a web-based way to run analyses in R. This means that you will only need an internet connection and a web browser to run your analyses. Your professor or administrator will provide you with a link to the web location of your RStudio Server. After entering the link, you’ll see a page that looks something like: Figure .: Login page for RStudio Server After logging in with your username and password, you should see a layout similar to what follows. Figure .: Initial page for RStudio Server Basic Workflow with RStudio A good habit to get into whenever you start a new project with R code is to create a new RStudio project to go along with it. RStudio project files have the extension .Rproj and store metadata that goes along with the documents you’ve saved and information about the R environment you are working in. More information about RStudio projects is available from RStudio, Inc. here. If you are sharing homework or lab assignments with your instructor using RStudio Server, for example, it might make sense to create an RStudio project, share it with your instructor, and then create new folders for each lab. We will follow this example below. The GIF below shows you how to create a new RStudio project called initial and also your first R Markdown file. Note that you also may see a description about what version of R is running on your initial login like shown in the GIF below in the Console pane. Figure .: Create a new RStudio project and an R Markdown file We have our first_rmarkdown.Rmd file set up. Sharing Projects on RStudio Server Pro You will now see an example of how to share this project with another user. This will enable you and collaborators (other students, your instructor, etc.) to work on the Rmd file at the same time. This is similar to working on a Google Doc at the same time as someone else. RStudio Server comes in a couple different formats and you’ll need to make sure you (or your IT administrator) have installed RStudio Server Pro to use the Shared Projects feature. You can find more information from RStudio, Inc. on this here. Below is an example GIF of sharing this initial.Rproj project file with another user of the RStudio Server. Figure .: Share an RStudio project on RStudio Server Pro Both myself and bottk can now work together on this project. We can type our commentary and code into first_rmarkdown.Rmd or other files and save files to the common folder where initial.Rproj resides.
