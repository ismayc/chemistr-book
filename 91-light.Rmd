## The `chem_table` function

The `chem_table` function is essentially a wrapper function to the `pandoc.table` function in the `pander` package.  Here is the code for `chem_table`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
chem_table <- function(data, caption){
  names(data) <- pandoc.strong.return(names(data))
  pandoc.table(data, caption = caption, style = "multiline",
               split.tables = Inf)
  cat("\\newline")
}
```

We see here that `chem_table` expects two arguments:

- `data` is a data frame containing the variables you'd like to appear in the table
- `caption` is the caption we'd like to correspond to this table

Remember that you can run `?chemistr::chem_table` to bring up the help documentation for the function.

We first use the `pandoc.strong.return` function that bolds the column names.  We then
call the `pandoc.table` function in the `pander` package with `data` as our argument and then our entered `caption` parameter as the `caption` argument to `pandoc.table`. The last two argument for `style` and `split.tables` are used to ensure the outputted table appears as you might expect it to in the Word document: 

- `style` set to `multiline` allow headers and table rows to span multiple lines of text.  This may be helpful if you have long column names.

- `split.tables` set to `Inf` ensures that wide tables will not be split into multiple tables.

Lastly, the `cat("\\newline")` code specifies that an extra line of white space will be printed immediately following the table.

## The `include_graphics` function

The `include_graphics` function enables you to include pictures that are stored as image files (`*.png` or `*.jpg`, for example) into your Word document via R Markdown.  It is a function in the `knitr` package.  If you'd like more information on how to use `include_graphics` run `?knitr::include_graphics` in the R Console.  The important argument here is `path` which tells R where to look for the file you want to include.  

If you include your pictures in the same directory as your Rmd file you need only specify the name of the file here in quotation marks.  If you have a `figure` folder in the same folder as your R Markdown file, you'll need to specify that via something like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/myimage.png")
```

Whatever you specify as the chunk option `fig.cap` will appear as the figure caption.  You are also encouraged to name the R chunk, which will allow you to reference the figure later in your document as well as automatic numbering of the figures:

` ```{r myimage, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Here is my picture"} `

`knitr::include_graphics("figure/myimage.png")`

` ``` `

We could then reference our picture in the text of our document by using `\@ref(fig:myimage)`.
